🧠 Game Concept
Each player picks an emoji category (like 🐶 Animals or 🍕 Food).

Players take turns placing random emojis from their chosen category.

Only 3 emojis per player can exist on the board at a time.

Oldest emoji vanishes when a new one is placed.

First to align 3 of their emojis in a row wins!
